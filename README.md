# Racket - A multicast messaging system

Racket is a lightweight, broker-less messaging system that allows you to send messages to multiple subscribers.
It is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on performance and reliability.

Messages are sent to a multicast address that is derived from the stream name and on
multiple ports.
